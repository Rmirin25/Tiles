Play Flow – How does the game flow for the game player

The natural resources the characters need from a scene are blocked by an evil (barrier), so they are unable to get the natural materials, but are able to pick up and use non-natural materials (i.e. a walking stick, a broken mug, food, ect). With the non-natural materials, they are able to defeat other evils from different scenes.
